<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Antistatic Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cationic Antistic Agent</li><li>Anionic Antistatic Agent</li><li>Non-ionic Antistatic Agent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Antistatic agents are chemicals used to reduce or eliminate static electricity on surfaces. There are three main types of antistatic agents based on their chemical properties: cationic, anionic, and non-ionic. Cationic antistatic agents have a positively charged nitrogen atom, while anionic agents have a negatively charged sulfur or oxygen atom. Non-ionic agents do not have a charge. Each type of antistatic agent works by neutralizing charges on surfaces, preventing the build-up of static electricity.</p></p>
