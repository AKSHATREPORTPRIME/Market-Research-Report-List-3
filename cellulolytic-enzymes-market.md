<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cellulolytic Enzymes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>EG</li><li>CBH</li><li>BG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cellulolytic enzymes are divided into three main types: endoglucanases (EG), cellobiohydrolases (CBH), and beta-glucosidases (BG). EG enzymes break down cellulose by attacking internal glycosidic bonds, while CBH enzymes work on cellulose chains from the ends, releasing cellobiose units. BG enzymes then break cellobiose into glucose molecules. These enzymes play a crucial role in the conversion of cellulose into sugars, which can be further used for various industrial purposes such as biofuel production.</p></p>
