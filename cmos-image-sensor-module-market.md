<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Image Sensor Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Backside-illuminated (BSI)</li><li>BSI Stacked</li><li>Front-illuminated (FI)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMOS Image Sensor Module market is divided into three main types: Backside-illuminated (BSI), BSI Stacked, and Front-illuminated (FI). BSI sensors are known for their higher sensitivity and lower noise levels due to the light-sensitive surface being on the backside of the chip. BSI Stacked sensors offer even greater performance by stacking multiple layers of sensors for improved image quality. Front-illuminated sensors have the light-sensitive surface on the front side, which can lead to lower sensitivity and higher noise levels compared to BSI sensors.</p></p>
