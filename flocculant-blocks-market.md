<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flocculant Blocks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Charge</li><li>Negative Charge</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flocculant blocks are used to treat water by causing particles to clump together for easier removal. There are two main types in the market - positive charge and negative charge. Positive charge flocculant blocks work by attracting negatively charged particles in the water, while negative charge flocculant blocks attract positively charged particles. Both types effectively clarify water by promoting the settling of particles, but they target different types of impurities based on their charge.</p></p>
