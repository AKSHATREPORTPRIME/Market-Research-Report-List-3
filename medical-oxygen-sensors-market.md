<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Medical Oxygen Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Zirconia Oxygen Sensor</li><li>Optical Oxygen Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The medical oxygen sensors market consists of two main types: zirconia oxygen sensors and optical oxygen sensors. Zirconia oxygen sensors use a ceramic material called zirconia to measure oxygen levels. They work by measuring the electrical potential difference between the sensor's two sides, which changes based on the oxygen concentration. On the other hand, optical oxygen sensors use a luminescent material to measure oxygen. They emit light that is influenced by the presence of oxygen, allowing the sensor to determine oxygen levels in a healthcare setting.</p></p>
