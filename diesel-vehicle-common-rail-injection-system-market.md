<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel Vehicle Common Rail Injection System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low pressure pump system</li><li>High pressure pump system</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Diesel Vehicle Common Rail Injection System market consists of two main types: the low pressure pump system and the high pressure pump system. The low pressure pump system utilizes a pump to deliver fuel from the tank to a common rail, where it is pressurized at a lower pressure than the high pressure pump system. In contrast, the high pressure pump system employs a pump to deliver fuel directly to the common rail at a much higher pressure, resulting in better fuel atomization and combustion efficiency.</p></p>
