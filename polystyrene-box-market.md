<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polystyrene Box Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Cell Foam</li><li>Closed Cell Foam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polystyrene boxes are commonly used in packaging due to their excellent insulation properties. The market for these boxes can be divided into two main types: open cell foam and closed cell foam. Open cell foam is made up of interconnected tiny cells that allow air and moisture to pass through, making it a more breathable option. On the other hand, closed cell foam has sealed cells that do not allow air or moisture to penetrate, providing better insulation and protection. Both types cater to different packaging needs based on their unique properties.</p></p>
