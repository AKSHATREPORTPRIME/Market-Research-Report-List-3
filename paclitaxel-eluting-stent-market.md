<p><h1>Paclitaxel-eluting Stent Market Size Focuses on Market Dynamics, In-Depth Analysis and Future Projections of its Market Forecasted for Period from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Paclitaxel-eluting Stent Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>A Paclitaxel-eluting Stent is a medical device used in the treatment of coronary artery disease. It is coated with a drug called Paclitaxel which helps prevent the re-narrowing of arteries after an angioplasty procedure. This type of stent is designed to slowly release Paclitaxel over time, reducing the risk of restenosis.</p><p>The Paclitaxel-eluting Stent Market is expected to experience significant growth in the coming years, with a projected CAGR of 8.9% during the forecast period. The rising prevalence of cardiovascular diseases, coupled with advancements in stent technology, is driving the demand for Paclitaxel-eluting stents. Additionally, an increasing number of minimally invasive coronary procedures and the growing geriatric population are contributing to market growth.</p><p>A key trend in the Paclitaxel-eluting Stent Market is the development of bioresorbable stents, which are gradually absorbed by the body over time. These stents reduce the risk of long-term complications associated with permanent stents, offering a more patient-friendly option. Continued research and development efforts aimed at improving stent design and drug delivery mechanisms are expected to further drive market growth in the coming years.</p></p>
