<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Thread</li><li>Parallel Lines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flexible couplings market types include double thread and parallel lines. Double thread couplings are designed with two threaded components that engage with each other, providing a secure connection for transmitting torque. Parallel lines couplings consist of two shafts aligned parallel to each other, connected by flexible elements such as elastomers or spring fingers to accommodate misalignment and reduce vibration. Both types offer advantages in different applications, such as double thread couplings being more suitable for high torque transmission, while parallel lines couplings are preferred for ease of installation and maintenance.</p></p>
