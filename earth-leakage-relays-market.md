<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Earth Leakage Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Reset</li><li>Auto Reset</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Earth Leakage Relays are electronic devices used to protect electrical circuits from faults that can cause dangerous electric shocks or fires. Manual Reset Earth Leakage Relays require manual intervention to reset after a fault is detected, making them suitable for situations where safety checks are necessary before re-energizing the circuit. On the other hand, Auto Reset Earth Leakage Relays automatically reset after the fault is cleared, providing a more convenient solution for applications where immediate restoration of power is critical. Both types cater to different needs based on specific safety requirements.</p></p>
