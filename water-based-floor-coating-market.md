<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-Based Floor Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Soluble Coating</li><li>Water Dilution Coating</li><li>Water Dispersible Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water-based floor coating is classified into three main types: water soluble coating, water dilution coating, and water dispersible coating. Water soluble coatings dissolve completely in water, creating a clear solution that can be easily applied to the floor. Water dilution coatings are mixed with water before application, allowing for a more adjustable viscosity and coverage. Water dispersible coatings form a stable dispersion when mixed with water, providing a more uniform finish on the floor. Each type offers unique advantages for different flooring applications.</p></p>
