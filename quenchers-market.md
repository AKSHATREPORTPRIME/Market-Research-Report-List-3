<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Quenchers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dark Quenchers</li><li>Fluorescent Quenchers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dark Quenchers are compounds that absorb energy from a fluorescent molecule, decreasing its fluorescence intensity. They are commonly used in various analytical techniques to reduce background fluorescence and increase sensitivity. Fluorescent Quenchers, on the other hand, are molecules that can quench the fluorescence of a nearby fluorophore by non-radiative energy transfer. They are widely used in molecular biology and biochemistry for various applications such as real-time PCR and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays.</p></p>
