<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio-Based Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Biodegradable Bio-Based Resins</li><li>Biodegradable Bio-Based Resins</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bio-based resins can be classified into two main types based on their degradability: non-biodegradable bio-based resins and biodegradable bio-based resins. Non-biodegradable bio-based resins are derived from renewable resources but do not break down easily in the environment, making them a sustainable alternative to traditional petroleum-based resins. Biodegradable bio-based resins, on the other hand, are designed to decompose naturally, reducing their environmental impact and offering a more sustainable option for a variety of applications.</p></p>
