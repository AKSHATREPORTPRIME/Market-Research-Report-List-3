<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mobile Relay Network Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Infrastructure Less</li><li>Infrastructure Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The mobile relay network market comprises two main types: infrastructure-less and infrastructure-based networks. Infrastructure-less networks, also known as mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), do not rely on any fixed infrastructure or pre-existing network infrastructure for communication. They are formed by a collection of mobile devices that establish direct connections with each other to transmit data. On the other hand, infrastructure-based networks require the presence of fixed infrastructure such as base stations or access points to establish and maintain communication between mobile devices. These networks provide a more reliable and stable connection but are dependent on the availability of infrastructure.</p></p>
